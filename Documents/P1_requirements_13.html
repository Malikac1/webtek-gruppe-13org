				<h4>Purpose and goals</h4>

				<div class="indent">
					<p>
						The purpose and goals of Papa's is to inform new
						customers about Papa's; what Papa's is and what Papa's
						offers, as well as acting as a link between hungry
						customers and the cooks.
						<br /><br />
						The website will show customers the rich menu and the
						golden history, and the cozy essence of Papa's through
						our hand-crafted design. We will have a dedicated page
						to Papa's menu, include Enzo's and Papa's lovely and
						rich backstory, as well as a contact form to get in
						touch with Papa's.
					</p>

				<h4>Audience</h4>

				<div class="indent">
					<p>
						Papa's audience consists mainly of young adults,
						couples, and families looking for that little extra.
						<br /><br />
						Users would want to find and read about menu items;
						their history, their allergens, their ingredients, and
						the price. Some users may want to contact Papa's; be it
						for reserving a table for their whole family, or asking
						for their lost jacket. Other users may want to read
						about Papa's history and the culture surrounding it.

				<h4>Content and organization</h4>

				<div class="indent">
					<h5>Necessary pages and features</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h6>Landing page</h6>
							<div class="indent">
								<p>
									The landing page will be where our users'
									first impressions are made. Therefore, this
									page must encapsulate the essence of Papa's
									culinary pride.
									<br /><br />
									The landing page should allow for easy
									access to the other parts of the site,
									whilst also giving the user a glimpse of
									what's to see (and eat). The page should
									include images representing Papa's
								</p>
							</div>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h6>Menu page</h6>
							<div class="indent">
								<p>
									This will be the "main attraction" on our
									site. It will show all menu items neatly
									sorted so the user can swiftly find what
									they are looking for, providing the same
									top-notch experience as Papa's. We have not
									set in stone how we will pursue this, but we
									will likely use a table, a list, or a flex
									grid.
								</p>
							</div>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h6>About page</h6>
							<div class="indent">
								<p>
									The about page will tell the users about
									Papa's and Enzo and their respective
									culinary beginnings. Enzo's biggest
									inspiration is his grandmother, and the page
									should capture that. The page will include
									text and some images.
								</p>
							</div>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h6>Contact us page</h6>
							<div class="indent">
								<p>
									The contact us page will let the user
									communicate with Papa's. We will use a form
									and the mailto protocol to satisfy this
									requirement.
								</p>

						</li>
